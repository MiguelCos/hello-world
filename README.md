# hello-world
Just to share random stuff about what I'll do with my GitHub account

Hello everyone! My name is Miguel and I am a biologist currently learning about data science and bioinformatics. Currently completing the data science track of Coursera from John Hopkins University and learning on my own about bioinformatics tools in R for proteomics. I will be updating this account with things I am learning and sharing it with anyone that might be interested.
